    "It's definitely a good article for both cs majors and non-majors to read. It is also especially insightful for people who know nothing about AI. For me, I learn a picture about what level is the current AI at. I learn about the things that AI can do and can not do at this time. It is suprising to know that there are certian things that today's technology of AI still needs much to work on. For example, it can not understand code itself. The doubt on the misaligned AI and even evil/ destroying AI has since long existed. It is as hard to prove it true as to proce it false. Sometimes we just need to believe that we are smart enough.\n",
